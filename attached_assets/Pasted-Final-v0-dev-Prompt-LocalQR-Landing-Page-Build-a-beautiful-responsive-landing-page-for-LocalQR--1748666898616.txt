Final v0.dev Prompt — LocalQR Landing Page
Build a beautiful, responsive landing page for LocalQR — a platform for travelers, locals, and businesses to share curated recommendations through a personalized QR code and short link.

The site must be built using:

React + TypeScript

Tailwind CSS (with extendable theme)

Framer Motion (for scroll animations and hover effects)

The goal is to communicate simplicity, credibility, and global/local relevance, and to encourage signups through two focused CTAs. The design should follow a modular dark/light section pattern, include a language switcher, and use subtle SVG overlays (maps, outlines, stamps) for global/travel character.

🌐 General UX/UI Guidelines
Responsive (mobile-first)

Accessible (WCAG AA+): color contrast, alt text, focus states

Rounded, modern sans-serif typography (Inter or DM Sans)

Use Tailwind utilities for layout and spacing

No illustrations; use photo placeholders or mockups

Include language switcher top-right

Use non-intrusive SVG overlays in backgrounds for visual character
